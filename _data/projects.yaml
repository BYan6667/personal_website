      title: MiniConf
      authors: Alexander Rush, Hendrik Strobelt
      abstract: MiniConf is a project developed for ICLR as an easy-to-use tool for hosting fully remote asynchronous virtual conferences. It was heavily used in 2020 to host ACL, ICML, AKBC, AIStats, and many other virtual conferences.

      title: NLP Browser
      authors: Alexander Rush
      abstract: NLP Browser is a web app that lets any easily browse through more than 150 datasets used in NLP and hosted by Hugging Face. The app is a pretty addictive way to casually learn about new datasets and challenges.

      title: NamedTensor (Tensor Considered Harmful)
      abstract: Named Tensor is a proposal for adding a new datastructure to mathematical libraries to tread tensors more like dicts and less like tuples. This blog post had the impact of getting PyTorch to add a NamedTensor annotation in v1.3 of the libary.

      title: Torch Struct
      authors: Alexander M. Rush
      abstract: Torch-Struct is a passion project of mine to test out whether deep learning libraries can be used to implement classical structured prediction. It includes heavily-tested reference reimplementations of many core NLP algorithms.

      title: The Annotated Transformer
      abstract: The annotated transformer was an experiment in blogging based on literate papers. The idea was to teach researchers how an important model in NLP works by aligning the paper line-by-line with an implementation. The blog post was widely distributed, and there have been many follow-ups for new model.
